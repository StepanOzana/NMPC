This paper describes the design and implementation of a nonlinear MPC control using REXYGEN and pysolnp. Objective: The design and implementation of nonlinear model predictive control algorithm that moves an overhead crane in x-direction to a given desired position setpoint 𝑟𝑥 while minimizing a given cost function over prediction horizon (RHC algorithm). The cost function may represent different requirements, typically minimization of swaying of the arm and other customized constraints.
